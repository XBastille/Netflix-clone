# Netflix Clone

This project is a front-end Netflix clone designed to simulate the look and feel of Netflix's streaming platform. It fetches movie data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API and allows users to browse trending movies, view details, and search for specific titles.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Movie Categories**: Displays various movie categories fetched from the TMDb API.
- **Trending Banner**: Showcases trending movies with a dynamic background image.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for movies and TV shows.
- **Hover Effects**: Movie cards expand on hover, displaying more information.
- **Play & Info Buttons**: Interactive buttons for movie interactions (placeholders).

## Project Structure

- **HTML** (`netflix.html`): The main structure of the webpage, which includes a header, banner section, and containers for movie lists. It links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **CSS** (`netflix.css`): Styles the webpage to resemble Netflix's UI, including a dark theme, responsive layout, and smooth hover effects.
- **JavaScript** (`netflix.js`): Handles the interaction with the TMDb API, fetches movie data, dynamically builds the movie sections, and adds interactive features like search and scroll events.

- Movie categories
